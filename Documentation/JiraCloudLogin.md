# Jira Cloud Account Setup Guide
This is an important update since a new secured login method enforced by **Jira Cloud** would take effect on 1st December 2018. **The current login method would stop working.** Please refer to the steps below to update your credentials. Note that this only affects Jira Cloud (https://arupdigital.atlassian.net or https://ovearup.atlassian.net). Our internal Jira Server (http://jira.arup.com) is working as usual.

### Step 1: Install the latest Arup Issue Tracker
[Download Installer (2019.4.17.1)](https://github.com/ArupAus/issue-tracker/releases/download/2019.4.17.1/Case_Issue_Tracker_2019.04.17.01.msi)

##### Please also make sure you have upgraded to Windows 10 and your Internet Explorer is up to date.

### Step 2: Click “Add Jira Cloud Account” button in the Settings__
##### __DO NOT__ input your email and password directly. You must click the "Add Jira Cloud Account" button.

##### If you see the below script error popup when adding a Jira Cloud account, please dismiss it by clicking either Yes or No. Then it will proceed as usual. This is due to browser compatibility but it wouldn't affect how it should work. We will try to suppress this kind of popup in the next release.

### Step 5: Login is successful when you see this message. Your Jira projects and issues will be loaded after clicking “OK”.

# Arup Issue Tracker
The Arup Issue Tracker (AIT) is a set of tools designed to manage the electronic workflow for reviewing and amending BIM models.  It currently works with Revit, Navisworks, Tekla BIMSight and Tekla Structures.

The tools can be used to store a list of 'Issues' in either a BCF file (BIM Collaboration Format) or using a web-based 'Issue Tracker' called Jira. This Issues can then be assignened, tracked and managed by the team in order to manage updates and tasks within the BIM model.
